Library Database

This is a simple library management system written in Java. It allows users to add, get, and return books.

To use the system, simply compile and run the LibraryDatabase class. You will be prompted to enter your student ID. Once you have logged in, you will see a list of the currently available books.

To get a book, type the name of the book and press enter. The system will check if the book is available and, if it is, will remove it from the list of available books.

To return a book, type the name of the book and press enter. The system will add the book to the list of available books.
